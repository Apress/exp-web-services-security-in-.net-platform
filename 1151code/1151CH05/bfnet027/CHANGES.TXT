03/02/19 - v0.27

- fixed in bug Blowfish class constructor, once Encrypt instead of 
  BaseEncrypt got called, leading to noncompatible CBC encryption
  results

02/09/20 - v0.26

- fixed bug in the weak key check

02/09/19 - v0.25

- added weak key property to the Blowfish class
- for zero padding, no more extra block is when data fits in a block 
- added comments to BlowfishAlgorithmTest
- CBC IV doesn't get generated anymore in BlowfishAlgorithmTest for ECB

02/09/17 - v0.24

- reverse padding during decryption wasn't correct for PaddingMode.Zeros
- BlowfishAlgorithmTest was set to the AES algorithm by default

02/09/16 - v0.23

- bug in the extended BlowfishAlgorithm constructor (key and IV 
  checks against null were reversed)

02/09/09 - v0.22

- BlowfishCBC was broken, the key setup in the constructor used the
  inherited Encrypt() method; fixed by introducing the BaseEncrypt()
  method, since there is no(?) other way in C#
  
02/08/27 - v0.21

- adjusted BlowfishAlgorithm to strip off padding data automatically 
  when it runs in PKCS7 mode
- made exceptions descriptive (in BlowfishAlgorithm)
  
02/08/26 - v0.20

- added test vectors from the official document on the Counterpane
  website to the test project
- all of the Encrypt() and Decrypt() methods now return the number 
  of blocks which were processed
- added wrapper which implements the .NET framework class 
  SymmetricAlgorithm, so Blowfish can now be used with standard
  interfaces; provided is also a test case for it
- changed the project name from "Blowfish for C#" to Blowfish.NET

02/08/21 - v0.13

- bug: hiding the methods in BlowfishCBC with the new modifier 
  caused the CBC code to use the ECB methods; all of the self 
  referencial code was removed
- simplified the BlowfishCBC constructor code
- removed the makefile, added a Visual Studio solution instead

02/02/16 - v0.12

- minimal speedup in the final swap parts of the cipher
- padding in BlowfishSimple is now done according to RFC 2630,
  yet still backwards compatibe to output of older versions 
- renamed BlowfishCbc class to BlowfishCBC
- all void class functions now return a self reference instead
- for clarity some methods are now declared as new
- namespaced the module as Blowfish_NET
- added a makefile to build the assembly and the test program

01/06/28 - v0.11

- increased the speed by 26% (optimized code, thanks go to the 
  MS C# team and Dr GUI)

01/06/21 - v0.10

- sources converted to .NET Beta 2, they won't compile under 
  Beta 1 anymore (changes made only in BlowfishSimple.cs,
  output should be compatible to the old version)

01/06/07 - v0.09

- adjusted the benchmark
- some typos in the comments

01/05/20 - v0.08

- fixed ugly bug in Blowfish.Encrypt() and Blowfish.Decrypt(),
  using start indexes other than zero caused a crash
- some documentation issues were solved
- new and powerful BlowfishSimple class

01/05/14 - v0.05

- new BlowfishCbc class for encryption/decryption in CBC mode
- XML documentation comments for the whole source code
- some methods in the class Blowfish became virtual
- extended BlowfishTest

01/05/12 - v0.01

(first release)
